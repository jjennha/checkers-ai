I tested my function at varying depths from 1 to 7.

I found that as my depth increased, my AI was able to stay alive longer and gain more points.
The tradeoff for having a better AI was that running the algorithm took much longer.  

It should be noted that I used a random generator to generate the choice of move imitating the user during testing.
